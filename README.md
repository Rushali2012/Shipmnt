# Shipmnt (Front-End Task) - Report Framework
This repository contains the implementation of a custom table with filters. The table features a search bar and multiple filter options that allow users to search and display data based on various conditions. The available filters are:

- ID: Supports equality, range, and comparison operations.
- Name: Allows searching by inclusion, exclusion, and exact matches.
- Role: Supports equality and inclusion checks.
- Hire Date: Provides filtering by exact date, date range, and comparison operations.
- Is Active: Filters based on boolean values.

The implementation is done using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. Users can apply multiple filters at the same time and easily search through the data, making it a versatile tool for data exploration and management.
